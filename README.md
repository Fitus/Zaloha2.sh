# Zaloha2.sh

Zaloha2.sh is the next step in development of [Zaloha.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha.sh), the small and simple directory synchronizer (a BASH script).

## Why a new repository and program name?

 * Some design changes break backward compatibility (see full list of changes below).
 * To keep the original [Zaloha.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha.sh) intact for the conservative user.
 * All functionalities of the original [Zaloha.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha.sh) are contained in Zaloha2.sh too.
 * For new deployments use Zaloha2.sh.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available both [online](DOCUMENTATION.md) as well as inside of Zaloha2.sh.

All other documentation and explanatory items from the original [Zaloha.sh](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha.sh) repository are valid for Zaloha2.sh too
([Article](https://fitus.github.io/), [Interactive Flowchart](https://fitus.github.io/flowchart.html), Usage Examples, Screenshot, Simple Demo, Performance Data).

## New feature 1: The Remote Backup Mode

In the Remote Backup Mode, the source directory is available locally, and the backup directory is on a remote backup host that can be reached via SSH/SCP.
This mode is activated by the option **--backupUserHost**.

### The Remote Backup Mode explained in eight sentences

 * The FIND scan of the source directory occurs locally (no change against Zaloha.sh).
 * The script for FIND scan of the backup directory (file 220) is prepared locally.
 * The script is then copied to the remote backup host via SCP and executed via SSH.
 * The obtained CSV metadata (file 320) is copied back from the remote backup host via SCP.
 * The CSV metadata is compared by a sequence of sorts and AWK processing steps (occurs locally).
 * The results (= prepared synchronization actions) are presented to the user for confirmation.
 * If the user confirms, the synchronization actions are executed (via SSH and SCP).
 * A non-interactive regime is available as well.

### Usage Example of the Remote Backup Mode

```bash
# Establish the SSH master connection
ssh -nNf -o ControlMaster=yes -o ControlPath='~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p' 'user@backuphost'

# Run Zaloha2.sh
./Zaloha2.sh --sourceDir="test_source_local"     \
             --backupDir="test_backup_remote"    \
             --backupUserHost='user@backuphost'  \
             --sshOptions='-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p'     \
             --scpOptions='-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p -T'

# Terminate the SSH master connection
ssh -O exit -o ControlPath='~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p' 'user@backuphost'
```

## New feature 2: The Remote Source Mode

In the Remote Source Mode, the source directory is on a remote source host that can be reached via SSH/SCP, and the backup directory is available locally.
This mode is activated by the option **--sourceUserHost**.

### The Remote Source Mode explained in eight sentences

 * The script for FIND scan of the source directory (file 210) is prepared locally.
 * The script is then copied to the remote source host via SCP and executed via SSH.
 * The obtained CSV metadata (file 310) is copied back from the source host via SCP.
 * The FIND scan of the backup directory occurs locally (no change against Zaloha.sh).
 * The CSV metadata is compared by a sequence of sorts and AWK processing steps (occurs locally).
 * The results (= prepared synchronization actions) are presented to the user for confirmation.
 * If the user confirms, the synchronization actions are executed.
 * A non-interactive regime is available as well.

### Usage Example of the Remote Source Mode

```bash
# Establish the SSH master connection
ssh -nNf -o ControlMaster=yes -o ControlPath='~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p' 'user@sourcehost'

# Run Zaloha2.sh
./Zaloha2.sh --sourceDir="test_source_remote"     \
             --backupDir="test_backup_local"    \
             --sourceUserHost='user@sourcehost'  \
             --sshOptions='-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p'     \
             --scpOptions='-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p -T'

# Terminate the SSH master connection
ssh -O exit -o ControlPath='~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p' 'user@sourcehost'
```

## New feature 3: Compare the contents of files via SHA-256 hashes

The option **--byteByByte** cannot be used in the Remote Source and Remote Backup Modes, because the CMP command needs local access to both compared files.

For the remote modes, a new option **--sha256** has been introduced. This option causes both FIND scans to additionally
invoke SHA256SUM on each encountered file. Note that the SHA-256 hashes of the files are calculated on the hosts where the files are located.
Also no contents of files are transferred over the network, just the SHA-256 hashes.
The SHA-256 hashes are then compared to detect files that appear identical but their contents differ.

## Performance tuning in the Remote Backup and Remote Source Modes

* The option **--noRestore** switches off creation of the restore scripts. If you do not need the restore scripts, use this option
  to shorten the analysis phase.
* The option **--mawk** instructs Zaloha to use **mawk** instead of (usually) **GNU awk**. **mawk** is an AWK implementation based on
  a bytecode interpreter and is significantly faster. To utilize **mawk**, it must be installed on the local system.
* The option **--findParallel** instructs Zaloha to run the FIND scans of the source and backup directories in parallel.
  As these scans run on different hosts, this will further save time.
* Last, **scp** can be tuned for higher speed by choosing suitable ciphers and compression levels. See **scp** documentation for details.
  Use Zaloha's **--scpOptions** option to pass additional command-line options to **scp** commands invoked by Zaloha.
  Faster **scp** will shorten both the analysis phase (faster copying of CSV metadata over the network) as well as the actual execution phase.
* Eventually use the High performance SSH/SCP â€“ HPN-SSH that removes the performance limitation due to statically defined internal flow control buffers.

## Obtain Zaloha2.sh

The simplest way: Under the green button "<b>Code</b>" above, choose "<b>Download ZIP</b>".
From the downloaded ZIP archive, extract Zaloha2.sh and make it executable (<b>chmod u+x Zaloha2.sh</b>).

## Add-on script Zaloha2_Snapshot.sh

The script for hardlink-based snapshots has been adapted to Zaloha2.sh: [Zaloha2_Snapshot](https://github.com/Fitus/Zaloha2_Snapshot.sh).
This allows to create **Time&nbsp;Machine**-like backup solutions.
